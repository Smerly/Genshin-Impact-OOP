# Genshin-Impact-OOP

 Replicating the gacha wishing/pulling system in the newest hit game, Genshin Impact. This will be a systematic display on the real percent rates of getting each character as well as each banner in Genshin Impact.


# What is the wishing/pulling system in Genshin Impact?

Genshin Impact is a gachapon game. What does this mean? Just like the gachapon machines in Japan, you can spend money for a chance to get a random character, all with different rarities. This python program replicates that function, but except you don't have to spend $2000 USD to get one five star character. 

This program can accurately put in perspective what it would be like to be a "whale". A whale is someone who spends thousands of dollars just to get character(s) they want.
